# kevinpowell-lp
My version of Kevin Powell's landing page, using only HTML and CSS.

Once again, training mostly CSS properties, in a slitghly more intense way.
Kept same structure, but did my own content - instead of shoes products I did a kiwi theme.

What did I used to do this project:
1. Figma
2. VS Code
3. HTML
4. Sass
5. CSS
